# About


> CryptoAdSolution is a community and industry-focused cryptocurrency developed in response to the difficulties of market services and master node cryptocurrencies. We promise an ecosystem that works today and in the future. We create a platform in conjunction with a hybrid system and cryptocurrency specializing in marketing services in the cryptographic industry. We prefer to deliver results instead of hype. There are too many coins, which are controlled by hype and after a coin sale show no more results. We clearly distance ourselves from such projects and provide our community with functioning products and infrastructure right from the start. Masternodes and Advertising Packages will be available, and functioning, on launch and are a fundamental part of this coin’s vision and will stabilize circulation, secure the network, and provide important functionality.
